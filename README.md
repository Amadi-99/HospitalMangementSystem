Hospital Management System provides the benefits of easy operations, patient care, and cost control. Hospital Management System is powerful, and easy to use and is designed and developed to deliver many benefits to hospitals. Traditionally, Hospital Details store in manually in the hospital. This system helps to store the hospital Details properly.

I have used Java language to design for the Hospital Management system and have used SQL databases in NetBeans to store data. And also, to manipulate these details meaningfully System input contains details while system output is to get these details on to the “Java Jframe”.

The real motivation for the hospital management system is to make the easy process of all the management processes like data storing, billing, channelling, etc. Hospitals currently use a manual system for the management and maintenance of information. This system avoids these problems in the hospital. Hospital Management System is designed considering main objectives. System Overview has System Design, GUI Design, and Data Modelling.
